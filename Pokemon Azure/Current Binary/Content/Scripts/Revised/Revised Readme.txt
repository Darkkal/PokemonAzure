This folder has the script parts that have been revised and worked on, and will
be used in-game. These parts are revised and shortened versions of the 'Rough
Drafts' folder. If there are any discrepancies, or something is flat-out wrong,
please notify Charmilio as soon as possible. This folder will be updated as the
scripting phase resumes.
